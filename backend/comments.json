She does not deserve all this hate. People keep criticising her saying that she can't sing. Think sensibly guys, There is no way she can be such a great singer without knowing how to sing. Just listen to these songs before saying things that hurt her. And she also said she has a thought to retire from music because of the hate but the good thing is she is releasing an album soon. Just wait for a little more time Selenators. The beautiful thing about her is that even though she going through so much hate in her life, she still wishes nothing but success to everyone. She may not have so many grammys like Taylor swift but Selena was never jealous of Taylor, She was always happy for her.\\nThese are a few favourite selena gomez songs:-\\n1. Adios\\n2. wolves\\n3.back to you\\n4.We don't talk anymore\\n5.Same old love \\nJust listen to these songs before saying things that hurt her. I am not saying you should love her, I am just saying that there is no reason to hate her. And even if you have a stupid reason to hate her, keep that hate to urself. *stupid because I don't see anything bad in her.\\nPS: All of selena's songs are my favorite.

Being brave and showing her feelings even though it hurts we understand and Selena you're beyond strong! You're gorgeus and if that man didn't understand then let it be you're good to yourself! Justin if you ever regret leaving this amazing lady know that you didn't leave her cuz she was weak but bcuz you were the one that didn't know to value such a strong and beautiful woman outside and inside!
