She does not deserve all this hate. People keep criticising her saying that she can't sing. Think sensibly guys, There is no way she can be such a great singer without knowing how to sing. Just listen to these songs before saying things that hurt her. And she also said she has a thought to retire from music because of the hate but the good thing is she is releasing an album soon. Just wait for a little more time Selenators. The beautiful thing about her is that even though she going through so much hate in her life, she still wishes nothing but success to everyone. She may not have so many grammys like Taylor swift but Selena was never jealous of Taylor, She was always happy for her.\nThese are a few favourite selena gomez songs:-\n1. Adios\n2. wolves\n3.back to you\n4.We don't talk anymore\n5.Same old love \nJust listen to these songs before saying things that hurt her. I am not saying you should love her, I am just saying that there is no reason to hate her. And even if you have a stupid reason to hate her, keep that hate to urself. *stupid because I don't see anything bad in her.\nPS: All of selena's songs are my favorite. Just mentioned a few I just heard a few minutes ago.","This song hits different when you’ve got a broken heart😭💔","Selena : in two months you replaced us like it was easy\nJustin : cause eternity with you ain't enough two seconds without you's like two months","We all listen to the same thing but are thinking of different people","Everyone is trying to find the right person, but nobody is trying to be the right person.","This is a really hard hit to Justin and he deserves it! I'm sure that Selena went to so many hard things and passed a really tough time but it passed now and she needed to let the world know that she is strong enough to pass a toxic relationship! Being brave and showing her feelings even though it hurts we understand and Selena you're beyond strong! You're gorgeus and if that man didn't understand then let it be you're good to yourself! Justin if you ever regret leaving this amazing lady know that you didn't leave her cuz she was weak but bcuz you were the one that didn't know to value such a strong and beautiful woman outside and inside! I really don't know what personality Hailey has but I'm sure that she'll never love you like Selena!","”I needed to lose you to find me”  so relatable and I’m still trying to find myself, and my self worth!! 🥺💯","Never thought of “loving” love.

Not until reading the lyrics in this music video.","Im watching this in 2021 She got out of a toxic relationship focusing on herself we get that But Obviously it will hurt to see someone who you once did love Get Married to someone Else And I get it so The lyrics are amazing So Selena Good on you Girl!😊 Okay sorry im tearing up-- gimme a sec","She's not just singing... she's talking to us\nLet's make her feel heard","Ya you are not the only one still listening to this masterpiece!
